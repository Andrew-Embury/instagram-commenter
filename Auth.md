# Product Requirement Document: Basic Authorization Implementation

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objective

Implement a robust, server-side authentication system using Supabase Auth for our Next.js application, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected content and functionalities.

### 1.2 Background

Our existing Next.js application has a complex logic structure. To maintain its integrity while adding authentication, we've decided to implement a wrapper-based approach for authorization.

### 1.3 Scope

This project encompasses the integration of Supabase Auth, creation of new components for authentication flows, and implementation of server-side authentication checks.

## 2. Features and Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication

- **2.1.1** Users must be able to log in using their email and password.
- **2.1.2** Implement a login window component (`Login-window.tsx`).
- **2.1.3** Create a component to display when users are not logged in (`Not-logged-in.tsx`).
- **2.1.4** Provide a logout functionality.

### 2.2 Authorization Wrapper

- **2.2.1** Develop an `AuthWrapper` component that encapsulates the entire application.
- **2.2.2** The wrapper should check the user's authentication status on every page load.
- **2.2.3** Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page when trying to access protected routes.

### 2.3 Server-side Authentication

- **2.3.1** Implement API routes for server-side authentication checks.
- **2.3.2** Ensure all server-side operations validate the user's session before processing requests.

### 2.4 User Experience

- **2.5.1** Display a loading state while checking authentication status.
- **2.5.2** Provide clear feedback for login errors.
- **2.5.3** Ensure smooth transitions between authenticated and non-authenticated states.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Technology Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Supabase Auth
- @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
- @supabase/auth-helpers-react

### 3.2 Integration Requirements

- **3.2.1** Use environment variables for Supabase configuration.
- **3.2.2** Implement Supabase client as a singleton for consistent usage across the application.

### 3.3 Performance Requirements

- **3.3.1** Authentication checks should not significantly impact application load time.
- **3.3.2** Minimize re-renders caused by authentication state changes.

## 4. Security Requirements

### 4.1 Data Protection

- **4.1.1** Ensure all authentication tokens are securely stored.
- **4.1.2** Implement proper error handling to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

### 4.2 Session Management

- **4.2.1** Implement secure session handling using Supabase's session management.
- **4.2.2** Ensure sessions are properly destroyed on logout.

## 5. Compatibility and Responsive Design

### 5.1 Browser Compatibility

- **5.1.1** The authentication system must work on all major modern browsers.

### 5.2 Responsive Design

- **5.2.1** Authentication components must be responsive and function well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Unit Testing

- **6.1.1** Implement unit tests for all new components and functions.

### 6.2 Integration Testing

- **6.2.1** Conduct integration tests to ensure proper interaction between the authentication system and existing application logic.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 Code Documentation

- **7.1.1** Provide clear comments and documentation for all new code.
- **7.1.2** Update existing documentation to reflect changes in application flow.

### 7.2 User Guide

- **7.2.1** Create or update user documentation explaining the new login process.
